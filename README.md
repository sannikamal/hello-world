## 🧑‍💼 About Me

I’m a data-focused engineering professional with a strong background in Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E), collaboration, administrative systems, and technical communication. I recently completed an MSc in Applied Data Science in Engineering to enhance my analytic skills. During the programme, I explored the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to work on engineering challenges—using data to identify potential equipment vulnerabilities, optimize processes, predict failures, and enhance decision-making in areas like design, operations, and maintenance. 

With practical experience working in public service and healthcare (including NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde), I’ve developed the ability to collect, clean, analyze, and communicate data-driven insights for strategic decision-making. I enjoy solving complex problems and collaborating across disciplines to drive impactful results.

Currently, I am continuing to enhance my analytics toolkit through hands-on projects and an internship focused on Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python, and AI with a nonprofit organization, **Black and Scot**.
